jTree.JS
========

<b>jTree.JS is currently in development. </b>
The idea behind jTree is to provide an easy to use, recursive tree, javascript framework.  
This framework can be used to present and organize recursive structures for end-users.  
For example, jTree could be used to present a filesystem with nested folders and files (google docs) or 
nested grous that contain people.  

jTree.JS is built on Backbone.JS, Underscore.JS, and Require.JS.
